                    I recieved a B.A. in Early Childhood Education from Cedarville University in 2016 and a JD from the University of Dayton School of Law

                    I have been tutoring students since 2013. My tutoring experience has ranged from kindergarten preparation all the way to ACT preparation;
                    however most of my experience has been with elementary students. I was designated a Top 20% Wyzant tutor for 2020 with 80% of my lessons
                    teaching elementary students. I tailor my lessons to the student's individual needs, making sure that they are not only effective but also
                    enjoyable.
